# hpcc-istio

## Install
This is tested local on Docker Desktop

```sh
istioctl install -f install-components.yaml
```

To uninstall
```sh
istioctl manifest generate -f install-components.yaml | kubectl delete -f -
```
## Enable istio-inject
Before start HPCC cluster enabble istio-injection
```sh
 kubectl label namespace ${hpcc_namespace} istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
```
The default namespace is "default"


## Side car lifecycle issue
Since default HPCC Systems cloud will use job pod for eclcc, eclagent and thor and job cannot terminate itself due to envoy still running. It is a known issue for any sidecar job pod for current Kubernetes release (1.19).

Kubernetes is planning to provide a fix but not sure when. The fix is not even in the feature gate yet.

JIRA HPCC : HPCC-24548
HPCC Pods hanging with istio envoy (sidecar) running

To work around the problem
### useChileProcesses:true
Set useChileProcesses:true for eclagent and eclccserver. 
This launch normal deployment pod instead dynamic job for compile and hthor/roxie workunits.
This doesn't help thor cases

### special Docker image
There is a special Docker image hpccsystems/platform-core:pilot-agent which has a private fix JIRA HPCC-24548


## Performance
With envoy side-car enabled the job pod start time is 2 to 5 longer than before. We will investigate and search a solution.

Added config option values.global.proxy.holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts, which causes the sidecar injector to inject the sidecar at the start of the podâ€™s container list and configures it to block the start of all other containers until the proxy is ready. This option is disabled by default. (Issue #11130)
